# Wildfire Survivor Management System

This is the development repository for two apps (Survivor Application and Survivor Dashboard) which together create the Wildfire Survivor Management System (WSMS).

## Origin Story

@AlenaNV, @cmatthey and I met each other at an IBM Call for Code Hackathon and submitted a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d_3tq-1y3BTtaHsHbbBHTFACioDKjJyVuCnjy360n_4/edit?usp=sharing">Proof Of Concept</a> after working with the Development Director from United Way (Northern California). He and his team were interested in moving forward so we did! @AlenaNV has created <a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/8Az7w">the Sketch files at this link</a> from the requirements we have gathered since then. I've been working on getting the MVP together. 

## Project Roadmap

- [x] Initial Kickoff + Gather Requirements
- [x] Initial Sketches (<a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/8Az7w">Sketch files</a>)
- [ ] Initial (Development) Survivor Application
- [ ] Initial (Development) Survivor Dashboard
- [ ] Initial (Production) Release for Survivor Application
- [ ] Initial (Production) Release for Survivor Dashboard

## Project Overview

The project is split into two apps: a Survivor Application and a Survivor Dashboard. Each user will have an account for their Survivor Application and each staff/admin will have an account for the Survivor Dashboard, which shows all users' Survivor Application data along with some internal admin-related data (financial assistance details, application status, etc.)
