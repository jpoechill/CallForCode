### TL;still reading

Here are broad areas where there is a need right now for contributions. There are some major assumptions/decisions that were made during the first few months of gathering requirements and building out the initial development Survivor Application, so if you have any intuition or suggestions for the following areas after reviewing our docs, please open an issue or send a message in the `#suggestions` Slack channel:

1. Architecture
     - How will this app operate if all existing survivors are actively using it? Expect anywhere from 8k - 13k users for the Survivor Application and 1-10 admin for the Survivor Dashboard.
     - Are there technologies that we could use which are better suited to manage personally identifiable data?
     - Are there technologies that would make our codebase cleaner and more maintainable?
     
2. Patterns
   - Are there patterns in any area of the app that are unreliable or incorrectly implemented?
   - Are there any patterns that expose any security risks? 
   - Are there any patterns that may result in poor UX?
   
3. Accessibility
   - Are there areas of the UI code that can be improved for accessibility? _Yes_
   - Are there systemic ways (documentation, testing, PR template) we can implement accessibility best practices into the development process?
   
4. Styling
   - Are there ways to improve our UI logic to make styling easier and more efficient?
   - Are there patterns, best practices and technologies that would make styling these apps easier and more maintainable?
